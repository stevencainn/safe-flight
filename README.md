## Functionality

Users will enter the site and proceed to book a flight as they normally would on other platforms like Kayak, Hopper or Google Flights. They will enter the destination they choose to fly from and the airport they are leaving from. Safe Flight then pulls all available flights that will be flown on secure airlines with no prior issues of malfunction. 

In future installments, we plan to allow users to save a flight under their "Travel List" to view at a later time.

----

## Upcoming Changes

* Add a Travel List section where users can save their flights 
* Add functionality to actually book a flight
* Add section for hotels
* Add User profile page

## Updates

#### Last Update:  
  01/215/21

#### What was Updated: 
  Fixed issue with API not working. Flight Results now populate the screen.

----

## Issues

Currently, the API used is very unforgiving and does not yield all of the desired fields.  Unfortunately, other travel APIs are costly or require an actual company account to get access to.  

API issues aside, most of what needs to be done is added functionality.  Some components and styling need to be refactored, etc.  We will come up with a cleaner to-do list soon when we get back working on this.
